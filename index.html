<h1> About me </h1>

My name is Will and I live in England. My most recently completed education is a BSC in Mathematics with the Open University. 

I currently work in retail, though my real passion lies with programming. Some of my most recent projects include:

 <ul>
  <li>Mylang - A language that looks like Python but runs like Rust</li>
  <li>Byte Size - A text compression tool that works better than smaz for common words</li>
  <li>Project Oak - A tool to help developers make installation packages that combines ease and flexibility of imperative systems with the rigor of declaritive solutions</li>
   <li> <a href="https://ray33ee.github.io/5b/">5b</a> - A tool for converting everything into everything else  </li>
</ul> 

My goals are to obtain employment as a Data Analyst, then eventually as a Data Scientist.

Professional AND personal interests include all things Mathematics, Statistics, AI and somputer Science. Personal interests include Strategy games, cooking, programming and baking.
